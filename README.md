# A example project created in React + typescript.

The app gives an indication on recommended insurences based on company size and company activities

Next steps:
1. Write tests for updating the shared state and testing more components (now only has a very small test)
2. Add routing
3. Look at a more scalable structure for the project
4. Hook up to an actual API ðŸ˜›

This app uses React hooks and Typescript. I never worked with React hooks and with React + Typescript, but I really like the combination.
This app also uses styled-components for scoped styling wich I think reduces a lot of overhead. Styled-comopnents was nice to work with but I feel I could improve on how I use it. The project took me longer than 4 hours, but was nice to work on and I learned a lot of new things.

I hope you like the result.
